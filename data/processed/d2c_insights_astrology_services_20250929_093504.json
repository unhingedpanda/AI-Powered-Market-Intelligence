The high cost per acquisition and low ROAS suggest that the audience might not be as qualified or the ad messaging is not resonating. Consider A/B testing different ad copy and landing page experiences. Re-evaluate keyword targeting to focus on high-intent search terms. Potentially reallocate budget from this campaign to higher-performing Meta Ads or Instagram Influencer campaigns."

        "recommended_actions": "This campaign has a very high CAC and low ROAS, indicating inefficiency. While the conversion rate is decent, the cost to acquire customers is unsustainable. Analyze influencer selection and audience reach. Ensure influencers are targeting relevant demographics and have genuine engagement. Negotiate influencer fees or focus on micro-influencers with higher engagement rates. Consider pausing or significantly reducing spend until performance improves."

Focus on improving on-page SEO for the targeted keywords to increase organic rankings and drive more qualified traffic. Optimize landing pages to better match user intent and improve conversion rates. Consider investing in content marketing to attract a broader, yet relevant, audience."

While there are strong performers like Instagram Influencer (CAMP_005, CAMP_042) and Meta Ads (CAMP_008) demonstrating high ROAS and efficient CAC, there are significant underperformers like Google Ads (CAMP_027) and one Instagram Influencer campaign (CAMP_011) that are draining budget with poor returns.
