    "average_rating": 2.08,
    "sentiment_summary": "The overall sentiment for TikTok is overwhelmingly negative, as indicated by the low average rating of 2.08/5. Users frequently express frustration with content moderation, account restrictions, censorship concerns, and perceived toxicity on the platform. Positive feedback is scarce and often overshadowed by these significant pain points. The app is perceived by many as a platform with serious issues regarding free speech, inappropriate content, and unfair account management.",

        "evidence": "Review 2: 'It’s really good but…. There’s some inappropriate things on the app. Like there’s filters of people having $3x…. There’s still some of those filters up. There’s also videos of people shaking their b00b$.' Review 19: 'First one being the things TikTok chooses to take down versus leaving up. I have seen literal porn on the app and it’s still up while I’m trying to post an edit a character might have their top falling a bit and it’ll get taken down. People leave very racist comments which TikTok does nothing...' Review 43: 'Please get rid of the inappropriate aspect of tik tok'",
        "recommendation": "Prioritize a review and enhancement of content moderation algorithms and human moderation processes to more effectively identify and remove inappropriate or harmful content, while ensuring consistent enforcement of community guidelines.

        "confidence_score": 0.85,
        "evidence": "Review 11: 'I noticed that I don’t have the repost button or see my repost anymore. Nor do I have the ability to post on TT story. The only way I’m able to do any of that is the uninstall and reinstall, but when I swipe out of the app, I lose it again.' Review 20: 'On my old account I could repost stuff and comment on my repost now I can’t .' Review 35: 'Nah so like i cant comment photos so that docks like 2 stars cuz like i wanna comment photos help me ticitoc💔💔🙏🙏❤️🙏💙💙🎋🎋'",

Ensure these features are consistently available across all user accounts and devices, and that updates do not inadvertently remove functionality."

        "evidence": "Review 4: 'They play favoritism they ban you for no reason also TikTok help is no help I would rather get Instagram anything else but TikTok.' Review 16: 'Unnecessary restriction of my account dms, can’t send messages without being flagged for NO reason.

This error I was having was impacting the user experience.' Review 18: 'i got banned bc someone false reported me and im PERMANENTLY banned like i cant make a new acc but it is what it is😞😞other than that this app is great and i recommend but like ugh tiktok wont respond to my emails so i gave up lol'",
        "recommendation": "Overhaul the account ban and flagging system to be more transparent and fair, with a robust appeals process. Significantly improve the responsiveness, helpfulness, and problem-solving capabilities of customer support to address user issues effectively and prevent users from being permanently banned due to false reports."

        "evidence": "Review 1: 'Hypocrites that don’t like free speech but support degenerates and worse' Review 22: 'Why is this social media app not allowing me to talk about the worst most horrible thing happening in the world right now? Hmmmm, I wonder who bought this social media app, seems very anti-free speech.' Review 40: 'this is the most racist app I have encountered. You cannot say the word “white” when referring to white people and must instead right “YT.” on the other hand saying “black “is not a problem. Racist white people are frequently allowed to spew hatred against Black people. Also, censorship is alive and well on this app.' Review 44: 'Unless you wanna be stuck in a right wing censored propaganda machine, jump ship now.'",
        "recommendation": "Review and clarify content moderation policies to ensure they are applied consistently and do not stifle legitimate discourse.
