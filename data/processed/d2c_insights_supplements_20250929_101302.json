        "recommended_actions": "Review keyword targeting and ad relevance. High average position (44.5) suggests poor ad rank, likely due to low Quality Scores or bids. Focus on long-tail keywords with purchase intent. Optimize landing page experience for conversion. Consider pausing or significantly reducing budget until performance improves."

While organic is cost-effective for traffic, focus on optimizing content for higher-intent keywords that drive purchases. Improve internal linking and user journey to encourage conversions. Investigate why revenue is low despite decent conversion rate."

While there are strong performers like CAMP_034 and CAMP_039 demonstrating high efficiency and ROAS, several campaigns, particularly CAMP_043 (Google Ads) and CAMP_037 (Organic Search), are underperforming significantly in terms of ROAS.
